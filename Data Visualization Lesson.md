# Data Viz Ain't Easy

In almost every business meeting you'll attend, you will see a poorly designed chart, graph, or other visual representation of data. Most people simply lack the education required to emphasize a point.  

Bad visualizations can be:  

- Difficult or impossible to interpret
- Filled with completely worthless information
- Misleading (intentionally or unintentionally)
- Redundant and boring
- Inaccurate


I have to give credit to [Junk Charts](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/j) - it inspired a lot of this post.
