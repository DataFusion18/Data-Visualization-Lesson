<h1>Data Viz Ain&#39;t Easy</h1>

<p>In almost every business meeting you&#39;ll attend, you will see a poorly designed chart, graph, or other visual representation of data. Most people simply lack the education required to emphasize a point.  </p>

<p>Bad visualizations can be:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Difficult or impossible to interpret</li>
<li>Filled with completely worthless information</li>
<li>Misleading (intentionally or unintentionally)</li>
<li>Redundant and boring</li>
<li>Inaccurate</li>
</ul>
